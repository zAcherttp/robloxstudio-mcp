# Roblox Studio MCP Plugin Installation Guide

Complete your AI assistant integration with this easy-to-install Studio plugin. Works with Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and any MCP-compatible AI.

## Quick Installation

> **Fork:** every method below installs **upstream's** plugin, which lacks this fork's tools and
> does not match its server. For this fork, run `npm run build:plugin` in your clone: it builds the
> plugin and copies it into Studio's Plugins folder. See
> [docs/workshop/01-setup.md](../docs/workshop/01-setup.md).

### Method 1: Roblox Creator Store (Easiest)
1. **Install from Creator Store:**
   - Visit: https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/132985143757536
   - Click **"Install"** button
   - Plugin automatically opens in Studio

2. **No restart needed** - Plugin appears immediately in toolbar!

### Method 2: CLI Installer
Run the installer bundled with the latest server package:

```bash
npx -y @chrrxs/robloxstudio-mcp@latest --install-plugin
```

Fully close and reopen Roblox Studio after the plugin is installed or updated.

### Method 3: Direct Download
1. Download [MCPPlugin.rbxmx](https://github.com/chrrxs/robloxstudio-mcp/releases/latest/download/MCPPlugin.rbxmx).
2. Save it to the Studio Plugins folder:
   - **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Roblox/Plugins/`
   - **macOS**: `~/Documents/Roblox/Plugins/`
   - **From Studio**: Open **Plugins > Plugins Folder**, then copy the file there.
   - Keep only one MCP variant in this folder. Remove `MCPInspectorPlugin.rbxmx` when installing `MCPPlugin.rbxmx`.
3. Fully close and reopen Roblox Studio.

## Setup & Configuration

### Optional: Allow third-party Creator Store assets

To preview or insert public Creator Store assets that you do not own, enable
**"Allow Loading Third Party Assets"** under
**Game Settings** > **Security**.
Roblox disables this setting by default.

### 1. Activate the Plugin
**Plugins toolbar** > Click **"MCP Server"** button
- **Green status** = Connected and ready
- **Red status** = Disconnected (normal until MCP server runs)

### 2. Install MCP Server
Choose your AI assistant:

**For Claude Code:**
```bash
claude mcp add robloxstudio -- npx -y @chrrxs/robloxstudio-mcp@latest --auto-install-plugin
```

**For Codex CLI:**
```bash
codex mcp add robloxstudio -- npx -y @chrrxs/robloxstudio-mcp@latest --auto-install-plugin
```

**For Claude Desktop/Others:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "robloxstudio-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@chrrxs/robloxstudio-mcp@latest", "--auto-install-plugin"]
    }
  }
}
```

`@latest` floats the server package to the newest npm release. `--auto-install-plugin` copies the matching `.rbxmx` bundled with that package into Studio's Plugins folder when the server starts.

The plugin and server must have matching versions. If Studio cannot connect after an update, restart the MCP server with `--auto-install-plugin`, then fully close and reopen Studio so it loads the matching bundled plugin file.

<summary>Note for native Windows users</summary>
If you encounter issues, you may need to run it through `cmd`. Update your configuration like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "robloxstudio-mcp": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@chrrxs/robloxstudio-mcp@latest", "--auto-install-plugin"]
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

## How It Works

1. **AI calls tool** > MCP server queues request
2. **Plugin receives it** over an authenticated persistent WebSocket
3. **Plugin executes** Studio API calls
4. **Plugin sends progress and the response** over the same socket; the server acknowledges retained responses
5. **AI receives** comprehensive Studio information

**Available Tools:** 50 tools for file trees, scripts, properties, attributes, tags, and more!

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Missing from Toolbar
- Verify file saved to correct plugins folder
- Restart Roblox Studio completely
- Check Output window for error messages

### Plugin Shows "Disconnected"
- **Normal behavior** when MCP server isn't running
- Click "MCP Server" button to activate
- Install MCP server using commands above

### Connection Issues
- Check Windows Firewall isn't blocking localhost:58741
- Restart both Studio and your AI assistant
- Check Studio Output window for detailed error messages

## Security & Privacy

- **Local bridge by default**: The plugin connects to `http://localhost:58741`
  unless you explicitly configure another server URL.
- **Explicit tool access**: The full plugin can modify a place when a write tool
  is called. Install the Inspector edition when you need read-only access.
- **Provider boundary**: Tool results pass through your configured MCP client.
  Your AI provider's data-handling policy applies to content sent by that
  client.

See the repository's
[configuration guide](../docs/configuration.md) for HTTP bridge authentication
and network settings. Report suspected vulnerabilities through the
[security policy](../SECURITY.md), not a public issue.

## Advanced Usage

### Plugin Features
- **Real-time status**: Visual connection indicators
- **Persistent delivery**: One authenticated WebSocket per edit or play-server peer
- **Multiplexed playtests**: Client routes share the play-server socket
- **Bounded recovery**: Reconnection resends retained progress/responses, not commands; use saved operation IDs and [verified staging/recovery](../docs/large-inputs.md) instead of blindly replaying mutations
- **Debug friendly**: Comprehensive logging in Output window

### Customization
- **Server URL**: Modify the single plugin URL field (default: http://localhost:58741)
- **Multiple Studio places**: Connect every place to the same MCP server, then use `get_connected_instances` and `instance_id` to choose the target game
- **Timeout semantics**: A request waiter's timeout is not an execution deadline or rollback; inspect `get_request_status` and actual effects before retrying

### Development Mode
```lua
-- Enable debug logging in plugin code:
local DEBUG_MODE = true
```

## Pro Tips

- **Keep Studio open** while using AI assistants
- **Plugin auto-connects** when MCP server starts
- **Monitor status** via the dock widget
- **Use AI tools** to explore game architecture, find bugs, analyze dependencies
- **Perfect for** code reviews, debugging, and understanding complex projects!
